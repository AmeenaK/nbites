* CURRENT BUGS & ISSUES

** Motion
*** TODO Gait switching interface
    Needs to be moved into more sensible location in Python and its interface needs to be rethought. How we do it now is unsustainable and bug-inviting. Possible gait FSA?

*** TODO Goalie issues

**** TODO Correct switching from squatting to squatted

**** TODO Correctly use spin find ball and chasing.

** Vision

** Localization

** Behaviors

*** TODO Fix stopping during approachBall, should never setSpeed(0,0,0) during approach or goTo

** Misc.

*** TODO Comment code
    Tucker: Localization, comm
    Joho: Motion
    Chown: Vision?
*** TODO Get more people. duh.

* NEW FEATURES
** High Level and biggest goals
   1. Significantly better localization
      * This entails improvements in a few places (vision, Kalman filter). Will allow for improvements in positioning and kick decisions.
   2. Kick engine
      * Omni-directional and distance varying kicks
   3. Precise stepping and stopping
      * More accurate positioning before kicks.
   4. Integrate previous components into behaviors

** Motion
*** TODO Double check the MOTION TIME STEP
    so we can make the switch to 10ms timesteps
*** Walking
**** TODO Navigator refuses Step commands
     when the walk is already active.
**** TODO Move each gait into a separte file
     All gaits get separate file, in a folder called motiuon/gaits
**** TODO Better Webots gait

**** TODO Fix factor of 2 in straffing
**** TODO Faster stopping
     Decouple Step creation and ZMP generation
**** TODO Walking interface to Python to move a certain distance & angle

**** TODO Fix/Dehack how walk engine does turning steps

**** TODO Make hip offsets variable, so we can widen stance of robot

**** TODO Rearchitecutre Walking (see details)
***** TODO Move more complexity out of step generator
      And into Controller/WalkingLeg, and make Step Gen really just a glorified list
***** TODO Movable steps

***** TODO ZMP recalculated after each frame depending on new steps

***** TODO Decouple ZMP and Step creation
      Should be solved also if ZMP is constantly recalculated
***** TODO Steamline cycloid calculation
      Put cycloids and trapezoids in own class and only compute once
***** TODO Consolidate FinalizeJoints
      Ensure that nothing identical is calculated twice
***** TODO See if STRAFE ZMP and L/R ZMP OFF can be merged
      once the stance width actually works
**** TODO Figure out a better way to use angleXY as sensor feedback
**** TODO Clean out MotionInterface of unused functions
**** TODO Figure out how to move each provider into its own directory
     This probably requires a motion/include folder, and potentially
     some virtual class to protect  other modules from including too
     many headers from inside motion
**** TODO DeHack the fake typing that exists inside MotionCommand.h
     The enum of Command types needs to go. Maybe replace with a static
     pointer to the associated Provider?
**** TODO Determine if the PyXXCommand wrappers could be removed entirely
     We might be able to totally remove the PyWrapper classes and just
     use boost to wrap the actual command classes directly
**** TODO Replace all pointers in PYXXCommands with boost pointers
     This would allow only creating those commands once in Python. Otherwise
     if the command is sent twice, a deleted pointer will get deleted again.
**** TODO Investigate if Python could be fixing mutexes
     Currently, if a walk command is sent, the python thread
     must wait until all the walking processing is finished before it is able
     to set the next command.  The walk provider should run pretty fast,  but
     it doesnt run instantaneously. This may not be a huge issue also because
     WalkCommands are only sent once a frame from python. A better solution
     might be to keep a list of waiting commands, and only lock the provider
     mutexes when the Switchboard is signaled.
**** TODO Remove the MOTION_DEBUG ifdefs from the headers
     this will speed up compilation when this flag is switched
*** Kicking

**** TODO [#B] Kick engine
     Needs adjustable resultant distances and angles. Dynamic depending on ball placement.
     Inverse kinematics plus COM-Control.

*** Head
**** TODO Look-To RelX, RelY in the HeadProvider

*** Misc motion
**** TODO Potentially redo velocity clipping in NaoEnactor
**** TODO Rapid spinning

** RoboGuardian
*** Implement NUBot esque fall positions
** Vision
*** TODO Opponent recognition (also with sonar)
*** TODO Open goal detection
*** TODO Improve lines

** Localization

*** TODO Improve Kalman filter
**** Investigate using unscented or multi-modal filter
**** TODO Improve handling of unexpected observations
     Could turn it off or use a counter for when to use observations again.
**** TODO Move from boost/UBLAS to the Eigen matrix library.
*** TODO Do ball covariance differently
*** TODO Investigate sensor based odometry
*** TODO Topological localization
*** TODO Teammate localization
*** TODO Opponent localization

** Behaviors

*** TODO [#A] Replace hand coded kick decision with computational best kick choice.

*** TODO [#A] Python kick objects.
    Objects store kick characteristics like distance, angle, and total move time.
*** TODO [#A] Kick objectives define high level desired ball placement.
    E.g. "in their goal", "opponent side of the field", "in front of my teammate"
*** TODO [#A] Improve positioning on ball before kick.
    Choose kick before stopping, then position accordingly.
*** TODO [#B] Better shot aiming
    First, aim where they're likely to not be. Then, add in shot detection.

*** TODO Goalie positioning

*** TODO Goalie saves (that do not harm the robot, preferably)
    e.g. kick leg out when ball is close enough, or at least a gentle dive.

*** TODO Fall protection, a la NuBots.
    Keep detection in C++, but increase its robustness and add Python mid-fall response.

*** TODO Smarter and faster panning, ball searching
    Don't look of the field, face the field

*** TODO Re-implement Aibo role selection as per NBites paper on subject

*** TODO Work out 3 robot deployment strategy

*** TODO Passing

*** TODO Monitor robot stability online:
    (maybe by amplitude of aX/aY oscillation),
    and potentially have behaviors react when this oscillation becomes too large
** Tools

*** TOOL

**** TODO Classifier.

*** Trac

**** TODO Use tickets more to manage team workflow

*** Other

**** Burst tools
     Check out the burst tools and adapt them to our needs. Possibly write integrate into
     TOOL.
