How To setup BOWDOIN/ROBOTICS wireless on a new Nao.

First you must first add the robot's wireless MAC address:

 * visit mymail.bowdoin.edu and add the MAC address manually

Then you must place the following files in the following places:

 * wireless.sh     -> /etc/init.d/wireless.sh
 * interfaces      -> /etc/network/interfaces
 * modutils (dir)  -> /etc/modutils (copy directory recursively, since modutils doesnt exist by default)

Then run the following commands:

 * update-modules
 * /etc/init.d/wireless start
