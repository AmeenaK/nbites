/*
 * Robots.cpp is where we do our robot recognition work in vision.
 * While it is true that this code sort of worked in 2008, we were
 * foolishly using high-res images at that time.  Since then the code
 * has languished and is frankly a mess.  However, the basic ideas
 * are pretty good and it could probably be salvaged when someone
 * has the time to do so.  We do not currently have this code turned
 * on.
 *
 * The major idea of this code is to do a highly modified version of
 * run-length-encoding where the runs are hybrid color runs that run
 * from the first seen bit of color in a scanline to the last.  Since
 * the colored pieces of the robot are not connected we often have
 * to glue disparate blobs together.  This is not easy to do and it
 * is where most of the work is needed.
