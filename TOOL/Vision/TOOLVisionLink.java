/**
 * This class provides the link to cpp. To get the results of vision processing
 * from cpp, you can call visionLink.processImage(), which returns a
 * thresholded image.
 *
 * Future Work:
 * IMPORTANT: When the cpp sublayer has an error (i.e. segfault), Java cannot
 *            catch it.
 *
 * It is not clear what the right format for the img_data is.
 * Vision expects to get a pointer to a continuous 1D array of length w*h*2
 *
 * In the future, we'd like to get back much more information --
 * like field objects, etc
 *
 * This class purposefully doesnt rely directly on the TOOL class,
 * so that it is easier to generate the native headers. If desirable
 * some work on the make file would allow you to pass in an instance of the
 * tool, allowing you to write to the tool.CONSOLE
