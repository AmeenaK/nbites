This file gives a brief overview of how the log file for the Monte Carlo
localization system is defined.

Each line of the file represents a single frame of information.

Each line is structured into three main parts separated by colons (:).

     paricle info : update info : landmark info

Particle Info
This is the information for all the particles.
Each particle has four associated values: x, y, h, and weight
There are thus P*4 space separated values in the group, where P is the number
of particles for the given data line.

Update Info
Space separated values in the following order:
      team color (0 blue, 1 red)
      robot number (1-4)
      x estimate
      y estimate
      heading estimate
      uncert x
      uncert y
      uncert h
      ball x
      ball y
      ball uncert x
      ball uncert y
      ball velocity x
      ball velocity y
      ball velocity uncert x
      ball velocity uncert y
      odometery x
      odometery y
      odometery h

Landmark Info
This is a space separated string of 3-tuples.
Each set of three of the form INT FLOAT FLOAT is a visual landmark ID followed
by the distance and bearing observed to it.
These landmarks include ball observations.
