This README describes the architectural implementation of the motion engine for
the Northern Bites robot soccer team. This document's purpose is to show where
in the code you should look for the code that fulfills a particular function,
or which file might have instructions to lead you closer to that answer.

For information regarding the conceptual meaning of the algorithms and
architecture implemented here, I suggest you look at the following documents:
 * Dynamically Balanced Omnidirectional Humanoid Locomotion, by Johannes Strom
   Honors Thesis for the Bowdoin College Department of Computer Science, 2009
 * An Implementation of an Omnidirectional Walk Engine on a Nao Robot, by
   Johannes Strom, George Slavov and Eric Chown in RoboCup 2009, 2009
 * Northern Bites Team Report for the Standard Platform League, 2009 (to appear)


Motion Overview:
The motion system is tasked with controlling the motion of the robot. For other
modules in the code, access to this functionality is provided by sending
MotionCommands through the MotionInterface, which is provided on request.
There are many types of MotionCommands, an incomplete list is:
   WalkCommand, StepCommand, BodyJointCommand, HeadJointCommand, etc

Inside the motion system, the many ways of controlling the motion of the robot
are controlled by the MotionSwitchboard. This class presides over a (currently
small) set of MotionProviders, and determines which provider is currently the
provider that is controlling the motion of the robot.  Theoretically, there
could be multiple active providers at once: one for each of the robots chains
(limbs). In practice, there are only ever two simultaneously active providers:
one for head, and one for the 'Body' (which excludes the head)
