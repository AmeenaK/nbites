This directory contains the files which are necessary for generating
the forward and inverse kinematics code using in man.


newKinematics.nb  contains the code to read in mDH parameters and generate
		  expressions for x,y,z (forward kinematics), as well as the
		  code for the search jacobians.
		  Read this file carefully. The different heel/ankle
		  versions must be generated carefully by generating `transform`
		  correctly.

leftLegIKResults.nb
rightLegIKResults.nb  these files contain the complete calculations for the
		      expressions. If an error is found, these should be updated
		      and they can also be used to compare later revisions

completeKinematics.nb  this is the old kinematics file. It is less general, but
		       included for reference.

convert-to-cxx.el  this file contains an emacs macro to convert a
		   mathematica expression copied using C-Shift-C to
		   something resembling the CXX code we need for kinematics.
		   It should be used only on a file with just mathematica code
		   in it (i.e. all spaces will get replaced with *, etc)
		   It will require some small after cleanup:
   		     -removing stray *
		     -removing stray !
		     -adding ; to the end of every line
		     - splitting the jacobian expressions with new lines for each tab
