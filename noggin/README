README Noggin

Noggin is the module of man housing all components which reason about the world
and make decisions about how the robot will act.  The main components are
localization, ball tracking, and behaviors.  Additionally
opponent tracking should be added to this module.  The module is controlled from
the noggin class which is defined in "Noggin.*".  The main noggin thread is called
every vision frame.

LOCALIZATION

Localization is the problem of determining where a robot is in the world.
This is performed using inputs of the last frame's odometry and any landmark
observations ("Observation.*") and gives output of an (x,y) coordinate and a
heading on the field, along with associated uncertainties. The interface defining
localization is "LocSystem.*". We currently have two implementations an extended
Kalman filter (EKF) systen "LocEKF.*" and a Monte Carloe localization (MCL) or
particle filter system "MCL.*".  See the system files for more
detailed documentation.

BALL TRACKING

Ball tracking as currently implemented through the use of an EKF. The ball tracking
system takes as input a ball observation and gives as output an estimate of the
ball's (x,y) position and (x,y) velocites, as well as associated uncertainties for
the four estimates.

OPPONENT TRACKING

Opponent tracking can be implemented similarly to ball tracking.  The one
additional problem is in correctly associating opponent robot sightings with the
correct opponent model.  There are many documented methods for doing this,
the first try would be doing a simple nearest neighbor data association.
