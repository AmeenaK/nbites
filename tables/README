This directory holds the calibration tables for the Northern Bites' Man
package for the Aldebaran Nao robot.  The tables themselves, however are not
stored in the same repository, and every subfolder of this directory will be
ignored by the man git repo.

However, if you initialize this directory to pull from the tables.git
repository on the RoboCup server (robocup@robocup.bowdoin.edu:git/tables.git),
you can check out various branches to pull the correct table.

More documentation to follow later...
