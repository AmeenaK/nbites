/**
 * This file processes vision with respect to the field.
 * The primary objectives of this processing are to determine where
 * in the visual field the field is and, if possible, where the edges
 * of the field are.  The former is achieved in the method
 * findGreenHorizon where the latter is done in findFieldEdges.
 *
 * findGreenHorizon works by starting at the pose calculated horizon.
 * Then it does some horizontal scanning every 4th line looking for the
 * first place where there is a threshold amount of green.  From there
 * it just tightens up the bound.
 *
 * findFieldEdges uses information found during thresholding - namely
 * the highest point in each column where green was seen during thresholding.
 * Its goal is basically to construct lines in much the same manner as
 * in field lines.  However, this problem is more highly constrained
 * and therefore is considerably simpler.  Since we get all of our
 * "line points" in order and don't have to worry about horizontal/
 * vertical issues we can avoid a lot of the checking necessary for
 * normal lines.  Essentially we scan through the points attempting to
 * grow line segments.  We stop any given segment when new points are
 * not part of the segment.  Once we have our segments we then analyze
 * them to see if they can be combined (e.g. a robot occluded a line)
 * and also whether they are truly at the field edge.  To do this we
 * project the line to each end of the image and make sure that none
 * of our other points lie "above" our projected line.  Normally the
 * end result should be no more than two lines (and a corner at their
 * intersection).
